1.Presentation Layer(Front end) : is the most used layer where the USERS can interact with applications
2.The middle layer(Businiess data tier): all the logic of the code is in(The hart)
3. Data access Layer :  
Data Tier(Back end)database acces: is where the information processed by the aplicattion is stored and managed
In a three- tier: the front end Layer cannot comunicate directly  with Back-end Layer .. has to go through Aplication tier
